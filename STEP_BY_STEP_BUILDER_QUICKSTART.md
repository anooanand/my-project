## 💡 Example: Narrative Writing

When student selects "Narrative", they see:

### Stage 1: Opening 🏠
**Objectives:**
- Introduce main character
- Establish setting
- Hook the reader
- Set the tone

**Prompts:**
1. Who is your main character? Describe their appearance and personality in 2-3 sentences.
2. Where and when does your story take place? Paint a vivid picture of the setting.
3. What is your character doing at the start? What is their normal world like?
4. How will you hook your reader? Start with action, dialogue, or an intriguing statement.

**Tips:**
✓ Start with something that grabs attention
✓ Use descriptive language to paint a picture
✓ Introduce your main character quickly
✓ Set the mood and tone of your story

**Examples:**
- "The thunder crashed as Maya huddled under the ancient oak tree..."
- "'Don't look back,' whispered Tom, his voice barely audible..."

**Minimum: 40 words**

---

### Stage 2: Inciting Incident ⚡
**Prompts:**
1. What event disrupts your character's normal world?
2. How does your character react to this event?
3. What problem or challenge does this create?
4. Why is this moment important for your character?

... and so on through all 6 stages

## 🎯 Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Struggling Student

**Before:** Stares at blank page
**After:** Sees clear prompts:

Student maintains clear structure throughout.

### Scenario 3: Teacher Review

Teacher wants to see student's progress.

**Progress View:**
- Stage 1: ✅ 50 words
