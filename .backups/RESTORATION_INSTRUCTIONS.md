## üì¶ Quick Rollback (Easiest Method)

If you don't like the new dark mode design and want to revert to the original light theme, follow these simple steps:

### **Option 1: Comment Out Dark Mode Import** (Recommended)
This is the fastest way to switch back without any file replacements.

1. Open: `/src/index.css`
2. Find line 5: `@import './styles/dark-mode-professional.css';`
3. Comment it out by adding `/*` and `*/`:
   ```css
   /* @import './styles/dark-mode-professional.css'; */
   ```
4. Save the file
5. Refresh your browser (or restart dev server)

‚úÖ **Done!** Your app is now back to the original light theme.

## üí° Alternative: Toggle Between Themes

Want the best of both worlds? You can easily switch between light and dark mode:

### **Create a Theme Toggle**

1. Keep the dark mode CSS import in `index.css`
2. The app already supports the `dark` class on the root element
3. Add a toggle button in your navigation to switch between themes

This way, users can choose their preferred theme!
