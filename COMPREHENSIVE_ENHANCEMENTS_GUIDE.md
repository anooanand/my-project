## üìò Examples Tab - Detailed Guide

### What It Analyzes

**For Each Genre, Checks:**

**Narrative:**
- Character description depth
- Setting vividness
- Dialogue presence & quality
- Figurative language usage
- Show-don't-tell ratio

**Persuasive:**
- Thesis statement strength
- Argument development
- Evidence quality
- Counter-argument presence
- Rhetorical devices

**Expository:**
- Topic introduction clarity
- Factual information presence
- Examples & evidence
- Transition usage
- Objective language

**Descriptive:**
- Sensory details (5 senses)
- Vivid adjectives
- Figurative language
- Specific details
- Atmosphere/mood

**Reflective:**
- Personal experience depth
- Reflection on learning
- Emotional honesty
- Growth/change description
- Broader meaning connection

### Example Output

**Student writes (Narrative):**
```
"She was happy to see her friend."
```

**System Detects:**
- ‚ùå Telling emotion instead of showing
- ‚ùå Weak character description
- ‚ùå No sensory details

**Provides Example:**
```
Category: Show Don't Tell
Suggestion: Show emotions through physical reactions

‚ùå Before: "She was happy to see her friend."

‚úÖ After: "Her face lit up with a brilliant smile as she
spotted her friend across the crowded room. She waved
enthusiastically, nearly dropping her books in excitement."

üí° Why This Works:
Instead of naming the emotion, we show it through:
- Physical reaction (face lighting up, smile)
- Action (waving enthusiastically)
- Details (nearly dropping books)

This makes the emotion vivid and real for readers.
```

## üìó Show-Don't-Tell Analysis (Narrative/Descriptive Only)

### How It Works

- Emotions: was happy, was sad, was angry, was scared, was nervous

- Reactions: was surprised, was confused, was disappointed

**For Each, Provides:**
1. **3-5 "showing" alternatives**
2. **Specific example** relevant to context
3. **Explanation** of technique

### Assessment Levels

- Strong use of showing throughout
- Minimal telling
- Vivid, engaging writing

**Good (1.5:1 to 3:1):**
- More showing than telling
- Some room for improvement

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Narrative Writing

**Student writes:**
```
Tom was scared. He was in a dark forest. It was scary.
He heard a noise.
```

**Examples Tab Shows:**

**Issue 1: Show Don't Tell**
```
Found: "was scared"
Quality: Basic (needs improvement)

Suggestions:
‚úì His heart pounded against his ribs
‚úì Cold sweat broke out across his forehead
‚úì He froze, unable to move or breathe

Example:
Before: Tom was scared.
After: Tom's pulse thundered in his ears, and his hands
      trembled as he peered into the shadowy trees.
```

**Issue 2: Setting Description**
```
Category: Setting
Quality: Basic

Suggestion: Create vivid sense of place using sensory details

Before: "He was in a dark forest."
After: "Ancient trees towered above him, their gnarled
       branches forming a canopy that blocked out the moon.
       The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and
       decay, and somewhere in the distance, something moved
       through the underbrush."

Why: Uses sight (trees, branches), smell (earth, decay),
     and sound (movement) to create atmosphere.
```

**Rubric Shows:**
```
Content & Ideas: Level 2 ‚Üí Target Level 4
Missing Elements:
- Detailed character reactions
- Rich descriptive details
- Emotional depth

Action Items:
‚úì Show fear through physical reactions
‚úì Add sensory details to setting
‚úì Develop character's thoughts and feelings
```

**Show-Don't-Tell Analysis:**
```
Assessment: POOR
Showing: 0 instances
Telling: 2 instances (was scared, it was scary)
Ratio: 0:1

Recommendation: Replace all telling with showing. Start with
               the "was scared" phrase.
```

---

### Example 2: Persuasive Writing

**Student writes:**
```
I think school uniforms are good. They help students.
Schools should have them because they're useful.
```

**Examples Tab Shows:**

```
Category: Thesis Statement
Quality: Basic

Suggestion: State your position clearly and confidently

Before: "I think school uniforms are good."
After: "School uniforms are essential for creating an
       equitable learning environment and should be
       mandatory in all public schools."

Why: Uses confident language, specific claims, and clear
     position. Avoids weak phrases like "I think."
```

**Issue 2: Evidence**
```
Category: Evidence & Support
Quality: Missing

Suggestion: Support arguments with specific evidence

Before: "They help students."
After: "According to a 2020 study by the National Education
       Association, schools with uniform policies reported 35%
       fewer incidents of bullying related to clothing choices.
       When students wear the same attire, economic differences
       become less visible, creating a more inclusive
       environment."

Why: Specific statistic, credible source, explanation of how
     evidence supports the claim.
```

**Rubric Shows:**
```
Content & Ideas: Level 2 ‚Üí Target Level 4
Missing Elements:
- Strong thesis statement
