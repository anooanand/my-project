# Real-Time Color-Coded Highlighting System

## ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE

The writing tool now has **real-time color-coded highlighting** that identifies 6 different types of writing issues as students type!

---

## 🎨 **Color-Coded Highlights**

### 1. **RED (#ff4444)** - Grammar Errors
**What it detects:**
- Subject-verb agreement: "He don't" → should be "He doesn't"
- Double negatives: "don't have no money"
- Common mistakes: "could of" → should be "could have"
- Their/There/They're confusion
- Your/You're confusion
- Its/It's confusion
- Run-on sentences with comma splices

**Example:**
```
"He don't like pizza" → "don't" highlighted RED
"I could of gone" → "could of" highlighted RED
"Their going to the store" → "Their going" highlighted RED
```

---

### 2. **ORANGE (#ff8c00)** - Weak/Overused Words
**What it detects:**
- Vague intensifiers: very, really, quite, just, actually
- Generic descriptors: good, bad, nice, great
- Weak nouns: things, stuff
- Weak quantifiers: a lot, lots of
- Weak verbs: got, get, gets, getting

**Example:**
```
"I was very happy" → "very" highlighted ORANGE
"The movie was really good" → "really" and "good" highlighted ORANGE
"I got lots of things" → "got", "lots of", "things" highlighted ORANGE
```

---

### 3. **BLUE (#4169e1)** - Passive Voice
**What it detects:**
- Pattern: to be verb + past participle
- Examples: was taken, were written, is being done, has been completed

**Example:**
```
"The ball was thrown by John" → "was thrown" highlighted BLUE
"The report has been written" → "has been written" highlighted BLUE
```

---

### 4. **GREEN (#32cd32)** - Excessive Adjectives
**What it detects:**
- More than 3 adjectives in a row
- Adjective overload before nouns

**Example:**
```
"The big, red, shiny, old, expensive car" → entire phrase highlighted GREEN
"A beautiful, amazing, wonderful, spectacular day" → highlighted GREEN
```

---

### 5. **PURPLE (#9370db)** - Sentence Structure Issues
**What it detects:**
- **Too long:** Sentences with 40+ words
- **Too short:** Sentences with less than 5 words (excluding dialogue)
- **Repetitive starts:** 3+ sentences starting with the same word

**Example:**
```
Too long sentence (50 words):
"The boy walked down the long winding road that led through the forest past the old oak tree near the creek where he used to play as a child before moving to the city..." → highlighted PURPLE

Repetitive starts:
"The boy ran. The boy jumped. The boy played."
→ All three "The" highlighted PURPLE
```

---

### 6. **YELLOW (#ffd700)** - Spelling Errors
**What it detects:**
- Common misspellings: teh, recieve, seperate, definately
- Proper noun capitalization errors
- Common typos

**Example:**
```
"I recieved the letter" → "recieved" highlighted YELLOW
"I cant beleive it" → "beleive" highlighted YELLOW
```

## 📊 **Statistics Panel**

### **Detailed Panel** (Right Sidebar - Writing Buddy)

## 🧪 **Testing**

Try typing these examples to see highlighting in action:

### Test 1: Mixed Issues
```
I was very happy their going to the store.
```
**Expected highlights:**
- "was" → BLUE (passive voice)
- "very" → ORANGE (weak word)
- "their going" → RED (grammar error)

### Test 2: Excessive Adjectives
```
The big red shiny old beautiful car drove fast.
```
**Expected:**
- "big red shiny old beautiful" → GREEN (5 adjectives)

### Test 3: Sentence Length
```
This is a very long sentence that just keeps going and going with lots of clauses and phrases and words that make it extremely difficult to read and understand what the main point is because it never seems to end.
```
**Expected:**
- Entire sentence → PURPLE (too long, 40+ words)

### Test 4: Repetitive Starts
```
The boy ran. The boy jumped. The boy smiled.
```
**Expected:**
- All three "The" → PURPLE (repetitive starts)

### Test 5: Spelling Error
```
I cant beleive I recieved this letter.
```
**Expected:**
