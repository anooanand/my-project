## ✅ What Was Changed

### 1. **Submit Button** - Purple to Blue Gradient 🎨

**Before:**
- Blue-cyan gradient
- Medium size (py-3)
- Basic shadow

**After:**
- Beautiful **blue → indigo → purple gradient**
- Larger size (py-4, text-lg, font-semibold)
- Enhanced shadow (shadow-lg → shadow-xl on hover)
- Smooth scale animation on hover (scale-[1.02])
- More rounded corners (rounded-xl)

```tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 via-indigo-600 to-purple-600
           hover:from-blue-700 hover:via-indigo-700 hover:to-purple-700
           hover:shadow-xl transform hover:scale-[1.02]"
```

### 2. **Prompt Section** - Gradient Background ✨

**Before:**
- Solid blue background (bg-blue-50)
- Simple border (border-blue-200)
- Standard shadow

**After:**
- Beautiful **blue → indigo → purple gradient**
- No harsh borders
- Smooth, modern appearance
- Taller when expanded (min-h-[180px] instead of 120px)
- Collapsed height increased for better proportions (h-16 instead of h-10)

```tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 via-indigo-50 to-purple-50"
```

### 3. **Placeholder Text** - More Inviting 📝

**Before:**
```
"Start writing here..."
```

**After:**
```
"Start writing your amazing story here! Let your creativity flow and bring your ideas to life..."
```

Much more encouraging and specific!
