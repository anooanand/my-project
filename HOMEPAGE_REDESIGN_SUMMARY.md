### 3. **`/src/components/HowItWorksSection.tsx`** ✅

### 4. **`/src/components/AppContent.tsx`** ✅
**Critical Update - Routing Changes**

**Changes:**

- ✅ Updated Route `path="/"`:
  - **Before:** `<HeroSection />`, `<FeaturesSection />`, `<EnhancedSuccessSection />`
  - **After:** `<HomePage onNavigate={handleNavigation} />`
- ✅ Updated Route `path="/home"`:
  - **Before:** Individual components
  - **After:** `<HomePage onNavigate={handleNavigation} />`

**Why This Was Critical:**
The previous routing was bypassing the HomePage component entirely and rendering individual components directly. This is why the redesign wasn't visible.
