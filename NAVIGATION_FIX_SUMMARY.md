# Navigation Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Issue:** After selecting a prompt, users were redirected back to dashboard instead of staying in the writing interface.

## 🔧 Root Cause

Prompts were only saved to localStorage, not to the database. When localStorage was cleared or unavailable, the prompt was lost, causing navigation issues.

## 💡 Solution Implemented

### Three-Layer State Persistence

1. **React State** (Memory) - Active during session
2. **localStorage** (Browser) - Survives page refresh
3. **Database** (Supabase) - **NEW: Permanent storage** ✅

### Key Changes

**Dashboard.tsx:**
- Added `saveWritingSessionToDatabase()` function
- Saves prompt to database after generation
- Saves prompt for custom prompts
- Saves prompt for fallback prompts

**AppContent.tsx:**
- Enhanced prompt loading logic
- Falls back to database when localStorage empty
- Syncs database prompt back to localStorage
