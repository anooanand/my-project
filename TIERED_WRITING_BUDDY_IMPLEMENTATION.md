# AI Writing Buddy with Tiered Support System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive AI Writing Buddy system with three-tiered support levels (High, Medium, Low) specifically designed for 10-12 year old students preparing for the NSW Selective Writing Test.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration: 20250710150000_add_support_level_system.sql)

**New Tables Created:**

- **`writing_buddy_preferences`** - Stores student support level preferences and performance metrics
  - Support level (High/Medium/Low)
  - Performance tracking (average scores, essay counts)
  - Skill levels (grammar, vocabulary, structure, creativity)
  - Auto-adjust preferences

- **`tiered_feedback_history`** - Records all feedback sessions with support level context
  - Tracks feedback effectiveness
  - Stores student ratings and engagement metrics
  - Links feedback to specific support levels

- **`support_level_recommendations`** - System-generated recommendations for level changes
  - Based on performance metrics
  - Includes confidence scores and reasoning
  - Tracks acceptance/rejection

**Database Functions:**
- `calculate_recommended_support_level()` - Auto-calculates appropriate support level
- `update_support_level()` - Manages level transitions with history tracking
- `record_feedback_session()` - Records and categorizes feedback interactions

**Security:**
- Full Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Proper authentication checks on all operations

### 2. Core Service Layer (`src/lib/writingBuddyService.ts`)

## How It Works

### Student Experience Flow

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - New users automatically assigned "Medium Support" (default)
   - Preferences created in database on first access
   - Welcome message adapted to support level

2. **Writing Session:**
   - Student selects text type and starts writing
   - Can switch to Chat tab for real-time help
   - AI responses adapt to their support level:
     - **High Support:** Gets templates, sentence starters, direct corrections
     - **Medium Support:** Gets targeted suggestions with examples
     - **Low Support:** Gets thought-provoking questions, subtle hints

3. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Every feedback session recorded to database
   - Performance metrics updated automatically
   - Skill levels adjusted based on writing quality
   - System calculates recommended support level

4. **Level Transitions:**
   - System recommends level changes based on performance
   - Student/parent can accept or reject recommendations
   - Manual level changes available anytime
   - History tracked for analysis

5. **Feedback Improvement:**
   - Students can rate feedback (thumbs up/down)
   - Ratings stored for system improvement
   - Focus areas tracked for personalization

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Student Input → TieredFeedbackChat
              → Backend (chat-response.js)
              → OpenAI with Tiered Prompt
              → Response adapted to Support Level
              → WritingBuddyService records session
              → Database (tiered_feedback_history)
              → Progress metrics updated
```

### Support Level Determination

```

    - Score ≥80% → Low Support (independent)
    - Score 60-80% → Medium Support (developing)
    - Score <60% → High Support (needs guidance)
