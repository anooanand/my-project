### Understanding Support Levels

#### High Support (Best for Beginners)
- You'll get:
  - Sentence starters to help you begin
  - Templates you can fill in
  - Direct corrections of mistakes
  - Lots of encouragement with emojis
  - Simple, clear explanations
  - Step-by-step help

- Example feedback:
  > "Great start! üåü I love how you began with action. To make it even better, try adding how your character feels. Here's a template: '[Character name] felt [emotion] as [what happened].' Keep going - you're doing awesome! üëè"

#### Medium Support (Best for Developing Writers)
- You'll get:
  - Specific suggestions for improvement
  - Before and after examples
  - Explanations of why something works
  - Questions to make you think deeper
  - Help with NSW test criteria
  - Vocabulary suggestions

- Example feedback:
  > "Good work on your opening paragraph! üòä You've established the setting clearly. Consider adding more sensory details - instead of 'The forest was scary,' try 'Twisted branches reached toward me like grasping fingers.' This shows the fear rather than telling it. What sounds might your character hear in this scene?"

#### Low Support (Best for Advanced Writers)
- You'll get:
  - Thought-provoking questions
  - Subtle hints instead of direct answers
  - Advanced vocabulary suggestions
  - Discussion of literary techniques
  - Exam strategy tips
  - Challenge to think critically

- Example feedback:
  > "Your narrative structure shows sophistication. Consider how the pacing in your middle section might be affecting tension. How could strategic use of shorter sentences amplify the climactic moment? Also, there's an opportunity for symbolic resonance with your opening image. What thematic connections might you strengthen?"

### Moving Between Levels

**You'll get recommendations when:**
- You've completed at least 3 essays
