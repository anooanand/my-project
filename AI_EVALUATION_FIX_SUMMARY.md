# AI Evaluation Weighting Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ ISSUE FIXED

The AI evaluation function now generates reports with **correct NSW Selective School rubric weighting**.

---

## 🎯 Problem

**AI was generating incorrect weighting:**
```
Ideas & Content: 7/10 (33.3%) ❌
Structure: 5/8 (26.7%) ❌
Language: 5/8 (26.7%) ❌
Grammar: 3/4 (13.3%) ❌
```

**NSW requires:**
```
Ideas & Content: /12 (40%) ✅
Structure: /6 (20%) ✅
Language: /7.5 (25%) ✅
Grammar: /4.5 (15%) ✅
```

---

## 🔧 Root Cause

The AI prompt in `/netlify/functions/nsw-ai-evaluation.js` specified the wrong maximum values:
- Old: 10-8-8-4 (wrong percentages)
- Should be: 12-6-7.5-4.5 (NSW percentages)

---

## 💡 Solution

### Updated AI System Prompt

**Added explicit NSW weighting instructions:**
```javascript
OFFICIAL NSW RUBRIC WEIGHTING (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY):
- Content & Ideas: 40% of total mark (12 points out of 30)
- Text Structure: 20% of total mark (6 points out of 30)
- Language Features: 25% of total mark (7.5 points out of 30)
- Spelling & Grammar: 15% of total mark (4.5 points out of 30)
```

**Updated response format:**
```javascript
"criteriaScores": {
  "ideasContent": {"score": number, "outOf": 12, "band": number},
  "structureOrganization": {"score": number, "outOf": 6, "band": number},
  "languageVocab": {"score": number, "outOf": 7.5, "band": number},
  "spellingGrammar": {"score": number, "outOf": 4.5, "band": number}
}
```

### Enhanced User Prompt

**Added critical requirements:**
```
CRITICAL SCORING REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST use the official NSW weighting for all scores:
- Ideas/Content: Score out of 12 (40% weight)
- Structure/Organization: Score out of 6 (20% weight)
- Language/Vocab: Score out of 7.5 (25% weight)
- Spelling/Grammar: Score out of 4.5 (15% weight)
```

```
