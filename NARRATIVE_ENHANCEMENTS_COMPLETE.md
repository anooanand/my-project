# Narrative Writing Enhancements - Complete!

## ✅ All Requirements Fulfilled

Your narrative writing experience now provides **comprehensive, contextual, NSW-aligned coaching** directly in the real-time AI Coach chat.

---

## 🎯 What Was Enhanced

### 1. **Contextual Examples in AI Coach** ✅ COMPLETE

The **Chat tab** (real-time AI Coach) now provides examples directly relevant to:
- Student's current writing
- Specific narrative prompt
- Current writing stage (0-50 words, 50-100, 100-150, etc.)
- Missing or weak elements

**What Students See:**

```
💡 Suggestion:
Instead of TELLING us how your character feels, SHOW us through
their actions, body language, and physical reactions.

📝 Example:
❌ Telling: 'I was scared when I heard the noise.'

✅ Showing: 'My heart hammered against my ribs. Cold sweat broke
out across my forehead as I heard the slow, deliberate footsteps
approaching. I pressed myself against the wall, hardly daring to
breathe.'

✨ Physical Reactions Replace Emotion Words
❌ Before: Sarah was nervous about opening the chest.
✅ After: Sarah's hands shook as she reached for the chest's lid.
Her mouth went dry, and she could hear her pulse thundering in
her ears. Twice she pulled her hand back before finally forcing
herself to grasp the ancient latch.

💡 Shaking hands, dry mouth, racing pulse, hesitation—all show
nervousness without saying 'nervous.'
```

## 💡 Example Student Experience

### Student starts writing narrative:

**Writes:** "I found a key in the attic."

**AI Coach immediately responds:**

```
Great start! Now let's introduce your character. 👤

🎯 Character Development - Opening

💡 Suggestion:
Your reader needs to meet your main character. Show us who they
are through their actions, thoughts, and appearance.

📝 Example:
❌ Telling: 'Sarah was brave.'

✅ Showing: 'Sarah took a deep breath, pushed aside her fear, and
reached for the glowing key. Her hands trembled, but she refused
to back away.'

✨ Character Introduction Techniques
❌ Before: A girl found the key.
✅ After: Twelve-year-old Maya had always been curious—sometimes
too curious, her mother would say. But as she held the ornate key
up to the light, watching its strange symbols dance across the
walls, she knew this discovery would change everything.

💡 This introduces age, personality trait (curious), a hint of
conflict (mother's concern), and the key in one powerful moment.

📊 Content and Ideas - Character
Current: Level 2 (Basic)

Target Indicators:
• Character has clear personality traits
• Character's motivations are evident
• Physical or emotional details included
• Character feels real and relatable

⭐ Next Step:
Add 2-3 sentences introducing your main character. Show their
personality through what they do, think, or say.
```

---

### Student continues:

**Writes:** "Sarah was scared when she opened the chest."

**AI Coach responds:**

```
Good progress! Let's make emotions more vivid. 💪

🎯 Character Emotions - Show Don't Tell

💡 Suggestion:
Instead of TELLING us how your character feels, SHOW us through
their actions, body language, and physical reactions.

📝 Example:
❌ Telling: 'I was scared when I heard the noise.'

✅ Showing: 'My heart hammered against my ribs. Cold sweat broke
out across my forehead as I heard the slow, deliberate footsteps
approaching. I pressed myself against the wall, hardly daring to
breathe.'

✨ Physical Reactions Replace Emotion Words
❌ Before: Sarah was nervous about opening the chest.
✅ After: Sarah's hands shook as she reached for the chest's lid.
Her mouth went dry, and she could hear her pulse thundering in
her ears. Twice she pulled her hand back before finally forcing
herself to grasp the ancient latch.

💡 Shaking hands, dry mouth, racing pulse, hesitation—all show
nervousness without saying 'nervous.'

✓ Replace 'scared' with: heart pounded, hands trembled, froze in place

📊 Language Features - Show Don't Tell
