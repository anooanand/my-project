# Tiered Support System - Now Live in Writing Interface!

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The AI Writing Buddy with three-tiered support levels (High, Medium, Low) is now **fully integrated** into the actual writing interface that students use.

## What Was Fixed

Previously, the tiered support system was built but integrated into a `WritingStudio` component that wasn't being used by the application. The app was actually using `EnhancedWritingLayoutNSW` for the writing interface.

### Changes Made

1. **Integrated into EnhancedWritingLayoutNSW** - Added support level system to the actual writing component students see
2. **Added Support Level Button** - Visible in the toolbar alongside Plan, Structure, Tips, Exam, and Focus buttons
3. **Updated EnhancedCoachPanel** - The AI chat panel now uses support levels for all responses
4. **Real API Integration** - Chat now calls the tiered chat-response backend function with support level parameter

## How Students Access It

### Step 1: Navigate to Writing Area
- Students go to the `/writing` route (the main writing interface)
- This loads the `EnhancedWritingLayoutNSW` component

### Step 2: See Current Support Level
- In the toolbar at the top, there's now a button showing their current support level
- Default is "Medium" for new users
- Button displays: **Sparkles icon + "High" / "Medium" / "Low"**
- Color-coded: Green (High), Blue (Medium), Purple (Low)

### Step 3: Change Support Level
- Click the support level button in the toolbar
- A modal appears with three options:
  - **High Support** - Maximum guidance with templates and step-by-step help
  - **Medium Support** - Balanced guidance with examples and suggestions
  - **Low Support** - Advanced prompts and subtle guidance
- Each option shows:
  - Description
  - Feature list
  - Current selection indicator (checkmark)
- Click "Select" on desired level
- Modal closes automatically

### Step 4: Use the AI Chat
- The AI Coach Panel is on the right side of the writing interface
- Ask questions about writing in the chat input at the bottom
- AI responses are now adapted based on selected support level:

  **High Support Response Example:**
  > "Great start! üåü I love how you began with action. To make it even better, try adding how your character feels. Here's a template you can use: '[Character] felt [emotion] as [action happened].' Keep going - you're doing awesome! üëè"

  **Medium Support Response Example:**
  > "Good work on your opening! üòä You've set the scene clearly. Consider adding more sensory details - instead of 'The forest was scary,' try 'Twisted branches reached like grasping fingers.' This shows rather than tells. What sounds might your character hear?"

  **Low Support Response Example:**
  > "Your narrative structure shows sophistication. Consider how pacing in your middle section affects tension. How could shorter sentences amplify the climactic moment? There's an opportunity for symbolic resonance with your opening image."

### Step 5: See It Adapt
- As students write and ask questions, they'll notice the AI's tone and depth changes with their support level
- High Support: More emojis, simpler language, direct help
- Medium Support: Balanced approach with examples
- Low Support: Challenging questions, advanced vocabulary

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Migration file created: `20250710150000_add_support_level_system.sql`
- Tables:
  - `writing_buddy_preferences` - Stores user support level
  - `tiered_feedback_history` - Records all feedback sessions
  - `support_level_recommendations` - Auto-generated level suggestions
- **Status**: Migration file ready, needs to be applied to Supabase

### Frontend Components
1. **EnhancedWritingLayoutNSW.tsx** ‚úÖ Updated
   - Added support level state management
   - Added support level button to toolbar
   - Added support level modal
   - Passes support level to EnhancedCoachPanel

2. **EnhancedCoachPanel.tsx** ‚úÖ Updated
   - Accepts supportLevel prop
   - Passes it to chat-response API
   - Shows loading states during chat

3. **SupportLevelSelector.tsx** ‚úÖ Created
   - Beautiful UI for selecting support level
   - Shows recommendations
   - Displays progress metrics

### Backend Integration
1. **chat-response.js** ‚úÖ Updated
   - Accepts supportLevel parameter
   - Three distinct system prompts (High/Medium/Low)
   - Context-aware responses based on word count and writing stage

### Build Status
‚úÖ **Build successful** - No errors, ready to deploy

## To Make It Work in Production

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
# Run the migration file:
# supabase/migrations/20250710150000_add_support_level_system.sql
```

The migration will:
- Create three new tables
- Add support_level column to user_profiles
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
- Create helper functions
- Initialize preferences for existing users

### 2. Test User Flow
1. Sign in to the application
2. Navigate to /writing
3. Look for the sparkle button in toolbar showing "Medium"
4. Click it to see the support level selector
5. Choose a different level
6. Ask a question in the AI chat
7. Verify response matches the support level style

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these are set:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI responses
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key

## Support Level Characteristics

### High Support (Green)
- **Audience**: Beginners, students needing maximum help
- **Features**:
  - Frequent emojis (üåü, üí°, üëè, etc.)
  - Sentence starters and templates
  - Direct corrections with simple explanations
  - Step-by-step micro-tasks
  - Lots of encouragement
- **Response length**: 3-5 short sentences

### Medium Support (Blue)
- **Audience**: Developing writers, most students
- **Features**:
  - Occasional emojis (üòä)
  - Targeted suggestions with explanations
  - Before/after examples
  - Critical thinking prompts
  - NSW criteria alignment
- **Response length**: 5-7 structured sentences

### Low Support (Purple)
- **Audience**: Advanced students, confident writers
- **Features**:
  - Minimal/no emojis
  - Higher-order thinking prompts
  - Subtle suggestions, not directives
  - Advanced vocabulary
  - Literary analysis focus

## Automatic Recommendations

After students complete 3+ essays, the system automatically:
1. Calculates recommended support level based on scores
2. Shows recommendation in the support level modal
3. Allows accept/reject of recommendation
4. Tracks recommendation history

**Recommendation Logic:**
- Average score ‚â•80% ‚Üí Recommend Low Support
- Average score 60-80% ‚Üí Recommend Medium Support
- Average score <60% ‚Üí Recommend High Support

## Testing Checklist
