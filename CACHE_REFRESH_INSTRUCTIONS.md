# Cache Refresh Instructions

## ‚úÖ Changes Are In The Code!

The UI improvements **have been successfully applied** to the source code:

1. ‚úÖ Purple gradient submit button
2. ‚úÖ Gradient prompt background
3. ‚úÖ Better placeholder text

**The issue is browser caching showing the old version.**

---

## üîÑ How To See The Changes

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Quickest)

**On Mac:**
- Chrome/Edge: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Safari: `Cmd + Option + R`

**On Windows/Linux:**
- Chrome/Edge/Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`

### Option 2: Clear Cache

1. Open browser DevTools (`F12` or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Click "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Restart Dev Server

If the above doesn't work:

```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it:
npm run dev
```

Then do a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

## üîç How To Verify Changes Are Applied

After refreshing, you should see:

### 1. **Submit Button** (at bottom)
- Should have a beautiful **purple-blue gradient** (not gray or solid blue)
- Should be larger and more prominent
- Text should say just "Submit for Evaluation" (no icon)

**Look for this color:**
```
Blue ‚Üí Indigo ‚Üí Purple gradient
```

### 2. **Prompt Section** (at top)
- Background should have a soft **blue-indigo-purple gradient**
- Not a solid light blue color

### 3. **Placeholder Text** (in writing area)
- Should say: "Start writing your amazing story here! Let your creativity flow and bring your ideas to life..."
- Not just: "Start writing here..."

---

## üìä Verification Commands

To confirm the changes are in the built files:

```bash
# Check if built files contain the new gradient
grep -r "via-indigo-600" dist/assets/

# Should show the purple gradient in the CSS file
```

## üö® If Still Not Showing

### Check Which URL You're Using:

1. **Netlify URL** (e.g., `vocal-kleicha-5b949e.netlify.app`):
   - You need to deploy the changes to Netlify
   - Run: `git add . && git commit -m "UI improvements" && git push`
   - Wait for Netlify to rebuild (2-3 minutes)

2. **Localhost** (e.g., `localhost:5173`):
   - Make sure dev server is running
   - Do a hard refresh
   - If still not working, restart dev server

### Your Screenshot Shows:
```
vocal-kleicha-5b949e.netlify.app/writing
```

This is a **deployed Netlify site**, not localhost!

---

## üöÄ To Deploy Changes To Netlify:

Since you're viewing the Netlify deployment, you need to push the changes:

```bash
# Stop any running dev server first (Ctrl+C)

# Stage all changes
git add src/components/EnhancedWritingLayoutNSW.tsx

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Update UI with purple gradient submit button and prompt background"

# Push to trigger Netlify rebuild
git push origin main

# Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify to rebuild
# Then hard refresh your browser
```

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix For You:

Based on your screenshot showing `vocal-kleicha-5b949e.netlify.app`:

**You need to deploy the code changes to see them on Netlify!**

The changes are in your local code but not yet deployed. Either:

1. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:5173/writing
   # Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
   ```

2. **Or deploy to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "UI improvements"
   git push
   # Wait for Netlify to rebuild
   ```

---

## üí° Why This Happens

- **Netlify** serves the previously built version
- Your **local code** has the changes
- You need to either:
  - View changes locally (`npm run dev`)
  - OR deploy to Netlify (`git push`)

Choose whichever you prefer!
