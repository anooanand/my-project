                [1] Max clutched his science project tightly as he walked into the school gymnasium. The annual Science Fair was the biggest event of the year, and as a new student, he was desperate to make an impression. His solar-powered water purifier had taken weeks to perfect.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
                [2] As he set up his display, Max noticed Tyler, the school's science champion for three years running, glaring at him from across the room. Throughout the morning, several mishaps occurred. Max's display board kept falling over, and his carefully prepared handouts mysteriously disappeared. Later, he discovered that someone had tampered with his project's wiring.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
                [3] When the judges reached Max's table, disaster struck. As he flipped the switch to demonstrate his purifier, there was a loud pop and a puff of smoke. The judges frowned and moved on while laughter erupted from Tyler's direction. In desperation, Max pulled apart his project and discovered a crossed wire that couldn't have been accidental.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
                [4] With only fifteen minutes before final judging, Max frantically rewired his project. He called out to Tyler, asking to borrow a screwdriver. Surprised, Tyler brought it over. "I know it was you," Max whispered, "but I still need your help." Red-faced, Tyler stayed and helped Max repair the damage he had caused.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800">
                [5] When the judges returned, Max and Tyler together demonstrated how the purifier worked. Max won second place, while Tyler's project took first. At the award ceremony, Tyler publicly apologized for his sabotage. By the next Science Fair, they had created a joint project that revolutionized the school's recycling systemâ€”and formed an unlikely friendship.
